# Security Best Practices

## .env File Security
- **Never commit .env files** to version control
- Use `.gitignore` to exclude all `.env*` files
- Store .env files in secure locations
- Use different secrets for each environment
- Rotate secrets regularly in production

## Configuration Security
- Separate secrets from variables in naming
- Use environment-specific secret values
- Never hardcode secrets in source code
- Use Prefect Secret blocks for sensitive data
- Implement proper access controls

## Code Security
- Validate all input parameters
- Sanitize file paths and user inputs
- Use secure file handling practices
- Implement proper error handling without exposing sensitive information
- Log security events appropriately

## Environment Isolation
- Use separate .env files for each environment
- Isolate development, staging, and production configurations
- Never use production secrets in development
- Implement proper environment detection
- Use different database connections per environment

## Dependencies
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Use `uv` for fast, secure dependency management
- Audit dependencies for security vulnerabilities
- Pin dependency versions in production
