# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current Container Testing Implementation has several critical issues that prevent reliable testing and deployment. This specification addresses the need for a robust, production-ready container testing system that properly handles environment configuration, service orchestration, health monitoring, and automated validation. The system must provide reliable testing capabilities for distributed processing workflows while maintaining development velocity and operational simplicity.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Environment Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want container environment configuration to be properly managed and validated, so that containers start reliably with correct settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN containers start THEN the system SHALL validate all required environment variables are present and properly formatted
2. WHEN environment variables use the CONTAINER\_ prefix THEN the ConfigManager SHALL automatically map them to the correct configuration sections
3. WHEN database connection strings are provided THEN the system SHALL validate connectivity before starting application logic
4. IF required environment variables are missing THEN containers SHALL fail fast with clear error messages
5. WHEN configuration changes occur THEN containers SHALL restart automatically with new settings

### Requirement 2: Service Health and Dependency Management

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want containers to properly manage service dependencies and health checks, so that the system starts reliably and fails gracefully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN containers start THEN they SHALL wait for all dependent services to be healthy before beginning processing
2. WHEN database services are unavailable THEN application containers SHALL retry connection with exponential backoff
3. WHEN Prefect server is unavailable THEN flow containers SHALL queue operations locally until connectivity is restored
4. WHEN health checks fail THEN containers SHALL provide detailed diagnostic information in logs
5. WHEN services recover from failures THEN containers SHALL automatically resume normal operation

### Requirement 3: Automated Test Validation

**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want automated tests to comprehensively validate distributed processing behavior, so that I can verify system correctness without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN distributed processing tests run THEN the system SHALL verify no duplicate record processing occurs
2. WHEN performance tests execute THEN the system SHALL measure and validate processing throughput meets minimum requirements
3. WHEN fault tolerance tests run THEN the system SHALL verify graceful handling of container failures and restarts
4. WHEN test data is inserted THEN the system SHALL validate all records are processed within expected timeframes
5. WHEN tests complete THEN the system SHALL generate comprehensive reports with pass/fail status and performance metrics

### Requirement 4: Two-Stage Build Process and Development Workflow

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a two-stage container build process that enables fast iteration cycles, so that I can maintain productivity during development while ensuring consistent environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the base image is built THEN it SHALL contain all system dependencies, Python environment, and core modules
2. WHEN flow images are built THEN they SHALL use the base image and only add flow-specific code for rapid builds
3. WHEN core code changes THEN only the base image and dependent flow images SHALL be rebuilt
4. WHEN flow code changes THEN only the specific flow image SHALL be rebuilt using the cached base image
5. WHEN using development mode THEN containers SHALL support hot reloading of flow code without full rebuilds
6. WHEN debugging issues THEN developers SHALL have easy access to logs, database, and container internals
7. WHEN running tests locally THEN the system SHALL provide fast feedback on test results and failures

### Requirement 5: Production Readiness and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a platform engineer, I want the container system to be production-ready with proper monitoring and operational capabilities, so that it can be deployed reliably in production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN containers run in production THEN they SHALL expose health endpoints for load balancer integration
2. WHEN system metrics are needed THEN containers SHALL expose Prometheus-compatible metrics endpoints
3. WHEN log aggregation is required THEN containers SHALL output structured logs in JSON format
4. WHEN scaling is needed THEN containers SHALL support horizontal scaling without coordination overhead
5. WHEN maintenance is required THEN containers SHALL support graceful shutdown with proper cleanup
6. WHEN base images are updated THEN the system SHALL provide automated rebuild and deployment of dependent flow images
7. WHEN container orchestration is needed THEN the system SHALL integrate with Docker Compose and Kubernetes

### Requirement 6: Resource Management and Performance

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want containers to efficiently manage resources and provide predictable performance, so that the system operates within defined resource constraints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN containers start THEN they SHALL respect CPU and memory limits defined in container configuration
2. WHEN processing load increases THEN containers SHALL maintain stable memory usage without memory leaks
3. WHEN database connections are needed THEN containers SHALL use connection pooling to minimize resource usage
4. WHEN concurrent processing occurs THEN containers SHALL coordinate to prevent resource contention
5. WHEN system load is high THEN containers SHALL implement backpressure to prevent system overload

### Requirement 7: Security and Isolation

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want containers to follow security best practices and maintain proper isolation, so that the system is secure and compliant with security requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN containers run THEN they SHALL use non-root users for application processes
2. WHEN sensitive configuration is needed THEN containers SHALL support secure secret management
3. WHEN network communication occurs THEN containers SHALL use encrypted connections where appropriate
4. WHEN file system access is needed THEN containers SHALL use minimal file system permissions
5. WHEN container images are built THEN they SHALL be scanned for security vulnerabilities

### Requirement 8: Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As an operations engineer, I want the container system to handle errors gracefully and recover automatically from transient failures, so that manual intervention is minimized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN transient database errors occur THEN containers SHALL retry operations with exponential backoff
2. WHEN containers crash THEN they SHALL restart automatically and resume processing from the last known state
3. WHEN network partitions occur THEN containers SHALL queue operations locally and sync when connectivity is restored
4. WHEN disk space is low THEN containers SHALL clean up temporary files and log rotation
5. WHEN critical errors occur THEN containers SHALL send alerts to monitoring systems before shutting down

### Requirement 9: Container Testing Framework

**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want a comprehensive container testing framework that validates distributed processing in containerized environments, so that I can ensure system reliability and performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN container tests are executed THEN the system SHALL validate distributed processing across multiple container instances
2. WHEN performance tests run THEN the system SHALL measure processing throughput, latency, and resource utilization
3. WHEN fault tolerance tests execute THEN the system SHALL verify graceful handling of container failures and network issues
4. WHEN integration tests run THEN the system SHALL validate end-to-end workflows across all container services
5. WHEN test environments are created THEN they SHALL use the same two-stage build process as production
6. WHEN test data is prepared THEN the system SHALL automatically populate databases with realistic test scenarios
7. WHEN tests complete THEN the system SHALL generate comprehensive reports with metrics and recommendations
