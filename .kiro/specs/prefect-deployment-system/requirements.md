# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create a comprehensive deployment management system for Prefect flows that simplifies the process of discovering, building, and deploying flows in both containerized and native Python environments. The system will provide clear developer workflows through Makefile commands and ensure all deployments are properly visible in the Prefect UI.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to automatically discover and gather all flows in the repository, so that I don't have to manually maintain lists of flows when adding new ones.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the flow discovery command is executed THEN the system SHALL scan all flow directories and identify valid Prefect flows
2. WHEN a new flow is added to any flow directory THEN the system SHALL automatically include it in the next discovery scan
3. WHEN flows are discovered THEN the system SHALL validate that they are properly structured Prefect flows
4. IF a flow has syntax errors or missing dependencies THEN the system SHALL report the specific issues and skip that flow

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create deployments for flows as both Python processes and containerized applications, so that I can choose the appropriate deployment method for different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating Python deployments THEN the system SHALL generate deployments that run flows as native Python processes
2. WHEN creating container deployments THEN the system SHALL generate deployments that run flows in Docker containers
3. WHEN generating deployments THEN the system SHALL support both deployment types for the same flow
4. WHEN container deployments are created THEN the system SHALL ensure proper Docker image building and tagging
5. IF deployment creation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating the cause

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want simple Makefile commands to manage the entire deployment lifecycle, so that I can easily build, deploy, and manage flows without complex command sequences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `make discover-flows` THEN the system SHALL scan and list all available flows
2. WHEN running `make build-deployments` THEN the system SHALL create both Python and container deployments for all flows
3. WHEN running `make deploy-python` THEN the system SHALL deploy all Python-based flow deployments
4. WHEN running `make deploy-containers` THEN the system SHALL deploy all container-based flow deployments
5. WHEN running `make deploy-all` THEN the system SHALL deploy both Python and container deployments
6. WHEN running `make clean-deployments` THEN the system SHALL remove all existing deployments
7. IF any command fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error output and exit with appropriate status codes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all deployments to be properly visible and manageable in the Prefect UI, so that I can monitor and control flow execution through the web interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deployments are created THEN they SHALL appear in the Prefect UI deployments list
2. WHEN deployments are created THEN they SHALL have clear, descriptive names that indicate the flow and deployment type
3. WHEN viewing deployments in the UI THEN each deployment SHALL show correct status, schedule, and configuration information
4. WHEN deployments are updated THEN the changes SHALL be reflected in the Prefect UI within 30 seconds
5. IF deployments fail to appear in the UI THEN the system SHALL provide troubleshooting guidance

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive documentation and setup guides, so that I can quickly understand how to use the deployment system and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the system THEN there SHALL be a clear setup guide with prerequisites and installation steps
2. WHEN using the deployment system THEN there SHALL be documentation explaining each Makefile command and its purpose
3. WHEN troubleshooting issues THEN there SHALL be a troubleshooting guide with common problems and solutions
4. WHEN adding new flows THEN there SHALL be guidelines on proper flow structure and naming conventions
5. IF the Prefect UI is not showing deployments THEN there SHALL be specific debugging steps provided

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to handle environment-specific configurations, so that flows can be deployed with appropriate settings for development, staging, and production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating deployments THEN the system SHALL support environment-specific configuration files
2. WHEN deploying to different environments THEN the system SHALL use the appropriate configuration for that environment
3. WHEN environment configurations are missing THEN the system SHALL use sensible defaults and warn the user
4. WHEN switching between environments THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate which environment is active
5. IF environment configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL validate and report specific configuration errors

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the deployment system to validate flow dependencies and Docker images, so that deployments don't fail due to missing requirements or build issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating Python deployments THEN the system SHALL validate that all Python dependencies are available
2. WHEN creating container deployments THEN the system SHALL validate that Docker images build successfully
3. WHEN validating dependencies THEN the system SHALL check for version conflicts and missing packages
4. WHEN Docker builds fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear build logs and error information
5. IF validation fails THEN the system SHALL prevent deployment creation and provide remediation steps
