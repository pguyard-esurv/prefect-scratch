# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a distributed processing system that prevents duplicate record processing when deploying multiple container instances of Prefect flows. The system will use database-level locking to ensure each record is processed exactly once, even when multiple flow instances are running concurrently. This system will integrate with the existing unified DatabaseManager and support multi-database operations (PostgreSQL for queuing/results, SQL Server for source data).

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Database Queue Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a database-backed processing queue that can handle concurrent access from multiple containers, so that records are processed exactly once without duplicates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple containers attempt to claim records THEN the system SHALL use `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` to prevent race conditions
2. WHEN a record is claimed THEN the system SHALL atomically update its status to 'processing' and assign a unique flow instance ID
3. WHEN records are in the queue THEN the system SHALL support statuses: pending, processing, completed, failed
4. WHEN querying for available records THEN the system SHALL return records ordered by creation time (FIFO)
5. IF a record claim operation fails THEN the system SHALL return an empty result set without throwing exceptions

### Requirement 2: Distributed Processing Logic

**User Story:** As a flow developer, I want a distributed processor that can claim and process records in batches, so that multiple containers can work on different records simultaneously.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN claiming records THEN the system SHALL support configurable batch sizes
2. WHEN processing records THEN the system SHALL handle individual record failures without affecting other records in the batch
3. WHEN a record is successfully processed THEN the system SHALL mark it as completed with results
4. WHEN a record processing fails THEN the system SHALL mark it as failed with error details and increment retry count
5. WHEN generating instance IDs THEN the system SHALL create unique identifiers to prevent hostname collisions

### Requirement 3: Multi-Database Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the distributed processing system to work with multiple databases (PostgreSQL for queuing, SQL Server for source data), so that I can read from existing data sources and write to appropriate destinations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initializing the processor THEN the system SHALL use separate DatabaseManager instances for each database (rpa_db, SurveyHub)
2. WHEN reading source data THEN the system SHALL use DatabaseManager("SurveyHub") for SQL Server queries
3. WHEN managing the processing queue THEN the system SHALL use DatabaseManager("rpa_db") for PostgreSQL operations
4. WHEN writing results THEN the system SHALL use the appropriate DatabaseManager instance for the target database
5. IF database connections fail THEN the system SHALL leverage DatabaseManager's built-in error handling and health check capabilities

### Requirement 4: Fault Tolerance and Cleanup

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want automatic cleanup of orphaned records and retry logic, so that the system can recover from container failures and network issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN records are stuck in 'processing' status for more than 1 hour THEN the system SHALL automatically reset them to 'pending'
2. WHEN cleaning up orphaned records THEN the system SHALL increment their retry count
3. WHEN a cleanup operation runs THEN the system SHALL return the number of records cleaned up
4. WHEN retry limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL keep records in 'failed' status for manual review
5. IF cleanup operations fail THEN the system SHALL log errors without affecting normal processing

### Requirement 5: Flow Template Integration

**User Story:** As a flow developer, I want a standardized template for distributed flows, so that I can easily convert existing flows to use distributed processing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a distributed flow THEN the system SHALL provide a reusable flow template
2. WHEN processing records THEN the system SHALL use Prefect's `.map()` operation for parallel processing
3. WHEN a flow starts THEN the system SHALL claim available records in the specified batch size
4. WHEN a flow completes THEN the system SHALL provide a summary of processed, completed, and failed records
5. WHEN individual tasks fail THEN the system SHALL not retry at the Prefect level to avoid conflicts with database retry logic

### Requirement 6: Health Monitoring and Metrics

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want basic health monitoring and metrics, so that I can track system performance and identify issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN checking system health THEN the system SHALL use DatabaseManager's health_check() method for all configured databases
2. WHEN monitoring queue status THEN the system SHALL report the number of pending records using database queries
3. WHEN generating metrics THEN the system SHALL track processing rates and error rates
4. WHEN health checks fail THEN the system SHALL leverage DatabaseManager's comprehensive health status reporting
5. IF monitoring queries fail THEN the system SHALL use DatabaseManager's built-in error handling and graceful degradation

### Requirement 7: Container Deployment Support

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the system to work correctly when deployed as multiple container instances, so that I can scale processing horizontally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple containers run the same flow THEN the system SHALL prevent duplicate processing of any record
2. WHEN containers start THEN the system SHALL generate unique instance identifiers using hostname and UUID
3. WHEN containers scale up or down THEN the system SHALL continue processing without data loss
4. WHEN containers restart THEN the system SHALL automatically recover orphaned records
5. IF container communication fails THEN the system SHALL continue processing independently without coordination requirements

### Requirement 8: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want the system to perform efficiently with proper resource utilization, so that it can handle high-volume processing workloads.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing records THEN the system SHALL reuse DatabaseManager and DistributedProcessor instances to avoid object creation overhead
2. WHEN connecting to databases THEN the system SHALL leverage DatabaseManager's built-in SQLAlchemy connection pooling with QueuePool
3. WHEN querying the processing queue THEN the system SHALL use proper database indexes for optimal performance
4. WHEN processing batches THEN the system SHALL support configurable batch sizes for throughput optimization
5. IF system load increases THEN the system SHALL use DatabaseManager's get_pool_status() method to monitor connection pool utilization

### Requirement 9: Error Handling and Logging

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and logging, so that I can troubleshoot issues and monitor system behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error messages with context
2. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL handle exceptions gracefully without crashing
3. WHEN processing individual records THEN the system SHALL capture and store error details for failed records
4. WHEN logging events THEN the system SHALL use Prefect's logging system for consistency
5. IF critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide sufficient information for debugging and resolution

### Requirement 10: Database Schema Management

**User Story:** As a database administrator, I want the distributed processing system to manage its database schema through migrations, so that the processing queue tables are created and maintained automatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN the system SHALL create migration files for the processing_queue table in core/migrations/rpa_db/
2. WHEN DatabaseManager initializes THEN the system SHALL automatically run pending migrations using the existing Pyway integration
3. WHEN schema changes are needed THEN the system SHALL support versioned migration files following the V{version}\_\_{description}.sql pattern
4. WHEN checking migration status THEN the system SHALL use DatabaseManager's get_migration_status() method
5. IF migrations fail THEN the system SHALL use DatabaseManager's migration error handling and rollback capabilities

### Requirement 11: Configuration and Environment Support

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want flexible configuration options, so that I can deploy the system across different environments with appropriate settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring databases THEN the system SHALL use DatabaseManager's ConfigManager integration for environment-specific settings
2. WHEN setting batch sizes THEN the system SHALL allow configuration via environment variables or parameters
3. WHEN configuring timeouts THEN the system SHALL support customizable cleanup intervals
4. WHEN deploying to different environments THEN the system SHALL leverage the existing ConfigManager environment system
5. IF configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL use DatabaseManager's configuration validation and clear error messaging
