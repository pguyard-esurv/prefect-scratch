# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a unified database management system that provides transparent access to both PostgreSQL and SQL Server databases across all Prefect flows. The system will enable flows to manage their own database tables through simple migration files while leveraging SQLAlchemy's connection pooling and the existing configuration management system.

The implementation is based on the comprehensive design document at `docs/DATABASE_MANAGEMENT_DESIGN.md` and aims to provide a production-ready solution that integrates seamlessly with the existing Prefect workflow architecture.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Core Database Management

**User Story:** As a Prefect flow developer, I want a unified DatabaseManager class that handles connections to both PostgreSQL and SQL Server databases, so that I can focus on business logic rather than database connection management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a flow initializes a DatabaseManager with a database name THEN the system SHALL create a SQLAlchemy engine with connection pooling
2. WHEN a flow calls execute_query() with SQL and parameters THEN the system SHALL execute the query and return results as a list of dictionaries
3. WHEN multiple flows access the same database THEN the system SHALL reuse the same engine instance for connection pooling efficiency
4. WHEN a database connection fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and logging through Prefect's logging system
5. IF a DatabaseManager is used as a context manager THEN the system SHALL properly dispose of resources on exit

### Requirement 2: Multi-Database Support

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want the database management system to support both PostgreSQL and SQL Server databases transparently, so that flows can access different data sources without changing their code patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a flow configures a PostgreSQL database THEN the system SHALL use psycopg2 driver with appropriate connection parameters
2. WHEN a flow configures a SQL Server database THEN the system SHALL use pyodbc driver with appropriate connection parameters
3. WHEN a flow queries different database types THEN the system SHALL return results in the same standardized format
4. WHEN connection strings are provided for different database types THEN the system SHALL automatically detect and configure the appropriate driver
5. IF database type detection fails THEN the system SHALL raise a clear configuration error

### Requirement 3: Migration Management with Pyway

**User Story:** As a database administrator, I want an automated migration system using Pyway that manages schema changes through versioned SQL files, so that database schemas can evolve safely across environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a DatabaseManager is initialized THEN the system SHALL check for pending migrations in the core/migrations/{database_name} directory
2. WHEN run_migrations() is called THEN the system SHALL execute all pending migrations in sequential order using Pyway
3. WHEN a migration file follows the V{version}\_\_{description}.sql naming convention THEN the system SHALL execute it in the correct order
4. WHEN migrations are executed THEN the system SHALL track migration state in a schema_version table
5. IF a migration fails THEN the system SHALL halt execution and provide detailed error information
6. WHEN get_migration_status() is called THEN the system SHALL return current version and pending migrations information

### Requirement 4: Configuration Integration

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the database system to integrate with the existing ConfigManager, so that database credentials can be managed consistently across environments using the established patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a DatabaseManager is initialized THEN the system SHALL load database configuration from the existing ConfigManager
2. WHEN database configuration includes connection strings THEN the system SHALL securely retrieve them from the ConfigManager secret management
3. WHEN environment-specific configuration is provided THEN the system SHALL use the appropriate settings for the current environment
4. WHEN global database settings are configured THEN the system SHALL load them from the core configuration system
5. IF required database configuration is missing THEN the system SHALL raise a clear configuration error with guidance

### Requirement 5: Connection Pooling and Performance

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want efficient connection pooling and resource management, so that the system can handle concurrent database operations without resource exhaustion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a DatabaseManager creates an engine THEN the system SHALL configure QueuePool with configurable pool_size and max_overflow
2. WHEN connections are acquired from the pool THEN the system SHALL use pre_ping to validate connection health
3. WHEN multiple queries are executed concurrently THEN the system SHALL efficiently manage connection allocation from the pool
4. WHEN a DatabaseManager is disposed THEN the system SHALL properly close all pooled connections
5. WHEN get_pool_status() is called THEN the system SHALL return detailed connection pool metrics including pool_size, checked_in, checked_out, overflow, and invalid connections
6. IF connection pool is exhausted THEN the system SHALL handle overflow connections according to max_overflow configuration

### Requirement 6: Health Monitoring and Diagnostics

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want comprehensive health monitoring capabilities, so that I can proactively identify and resolve database connectivity issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN health_check() is called THEN the system SHALL test database connectivity and basic query execution
2. WHEN health monitoring is performed THEN the system SHALL measure and report response times
3. WHEN migration status is available THEN the system SHALL include it in health check results
4. WHEN health checks fail THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information and timestamps
5. IF multiple databases are configured THEN the system SHALL provide overall health status across all databases

### Requirement 7: Error Handling and Logging

**User Story:** As a flow developer, I want comprehensive error handling and logging integration with Prefect, so that I can quickly diagnose and resolve database-related issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database operations are performed THEN the system SHALL log operations using Prefect's get_run_logger()
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide contextual error messages with database name and operation details
3. WHEN running outside Prefect task context THEN the system SHALL gracefully fall back to standard Python logging
4. WHEN migrations are executed THEN the system SHALL log migration progress and completion status
5. IF connection failures occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed connection information for troubleshooting

### Requirement 8: Concurrent Processing Support

**User Story:** As a flow developer, I want to use DatabaseManager instances within Prefect's concurrent task execution, so that I can process data efficiently using parallel tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN DatabaseManager is used within concurrent Prefect tasks THEN the system SHALL handle thread-safe database operations
2. WHEN .map() is used with database operations THEN the system SHALL efficiently manage connections across concurrent executions
3. WHEN concurrent tasks write to the same database THEN the system SHALL handle connection sharing appropriately
4. WHEN task execution completes THEN the system SHALL properly clean up database resources per task
5. IF concurrent access causes conflicts THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and retry guidance

### Requirement 9: Security and Credential Management

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want secure handling of database credentials and connections, so that sensitive information is protected and access is properly controlled.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN connection strings contain credentials THEN the system SHALL handle them securely without logging sensitive information
2. WHEN SSL/TLS is configured THEN the system SHALL establish encrypted database connections
3. WHEN credentials are loaded from configuration THEN the system SHALL use secure secret management practices
4. WHEN database operations are logged THEN the system SHALL not expose sensitive credential information
5. IF credential validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide security-appropriate error messages

### Requirement 10: Advanced Database Operations

**User Story:** As a flow developer, I want advanced database operation capabilities including transactions, timeouts, and retry logic, so that I can handle complex data processing scenarios reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN execute_transaction() is called with multiple queries THEN the system SHALL execute all queries within a single database transaction
2. WHEN execute_query_with_timeout() is called THEN the system SHALL enforce the specified timeout and raise appropriate errors if exceeded
3. WHEN database operations fail due to transient issues THEN the system SHALL support configurable retry logic using tenacity
4. WHEN transaction operations fail THEN the system SHALL automatically rollback all changes within the transaction
5. IF timeout is reached during query execution THEN the system SHALL cancel the query and provide clear timeout error messages

### Requirement 11: Testing and Validation Support

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive testing capabilities for database operations, so that database functionality can be validated across different environments and scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integration tests are run THEN the system SHALL provide test utilities for database setup and teardown
2. WHEN migration testing is performed THEN the system SHALL support migration rollback and validation
3. WHEN performance testing is conducted THEN the system SHALL provide metrics for connection and query performance
4. WHEN mock testing is needed THEN the system SHALL support database operation mocking for unit tests
5. IF test databases are configured THEN the system SHALL isolate test operations from production data
