## Key Capabilities

### 1. Automated Deployment

```python
# Deploy single service
automation = DeploymentAutomation()
success = automation.deploy_service("rpa1-worker", "rpa-flow1:v1.2.3")

# Deploy all services from manifest
success = automation.deploy_all_services("deployment-manifest.json")
```

### 2. Horizontal Scaling

```python
# Configure scaling policy
policy = ScalingPolicy(
    service_name="rpa1-worker",
    min_replicas=1,
    max_replicas=8,
    scale_up_threshold=85.0,
    scale_down_threshold=30.0
)

# Perform scaling operation
om = OperationalManager()
result = om.scale_containers(policy)
```

### 3. Incident Response

```python
# Handle incident automatically
incident = Incident(
    incident_id="crash_001",
    service_name="rpa1-worker",
    severity=IncidentSeverity.HIGH,
    description="Container crashed"
)

response = om.handle_incidents(incident)
```

### 4. Operational Monitoring

```python
# Collect operational metrics
metrics = om.monitor_operations()
print(f"System uptime: {metrics.uptime_percentage}%")
print(f"Active incidents: {metrics.incident_count}")
```

## Command Line Usage

### Deployment Operations

```bash
# Deploy single service
python scripts/deployment_automation.py deploy \
  --service rpa1-worker \
  --image rpa-flow1:v1.2.3 \
  --config deployment-config.json

# Deploy all services
python scripts/deployment_automation.py deploy-all \
  --manifest deployment-manifest.json

# Rollback service
python scripts/deployment_automation.py rollback \
  --service rpa1-worker \
  --target-version v1.2.2

# Validate deployment
python scripts/deployment_automation.py validate \
  --service rpa1-worker

# Setup scaling policies
python scripts/deployment_automation.py setup-scaling \
  --scaling-config scaling-policies.json
```

### Test Execution

```bash
# Run all operational tests
python scripts/run_operational_tests.py --test-type all

# Run specific test types
python scripts/run_operational_tests.py --test-type unit
python scripts/run_operational_tests.py --test-type integration
python scripts/run_operational_tests.py --test-type validation

# Generate test report
python scripts/run_operational_tests.py --report operational_report.json
```
